✈️ Explore With AI: Custom Itineraries for Your Next Journey

An AI-powered travel itinerary generator that creates personalized trip plans based on user preferences, interests, and travel duration.

Say goodbye to hours of research. Let AI plan your trip in seconds 🌍

📌 Project Overview

Travel planning can be overwhelming — choosing destinations, finding attractions, organizing daily schedules, and matching everything with personal interests takes time.

Explore With AI simplifies this process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI to automatically generate custom travel itineraries tailored to individual travelers.

This project demonstrates how AI can enhance user experience in travel and tourism applications.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Personalized travel itineraries
✅ Day-wise trip planning
✅ Attraction and activity suggestions
✅ Local dining recommendations
✅ Supports different trip durations
✅ Easy-to-use interface
✅ AI-generated travel plans in seconds

🧠 How It Works

The user enters:

Destination

number of days

number of nights

The AI model processes the input using NLP.

A custom itinerary is generated including:

Daily schedule

Tourist attractions

Activities

Food recommendations
